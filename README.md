# RUN AWAY FROM GANGSTERS!

## INTRODUCTION

Hello! We are Pol Casaú and Xavi Marín, two students from the Design and Development of Videogames studying at CITM's Tech Talent Center. This game has been done for the subject of physics, with the objective of making a 3D Racing game, which includes a vehicle.

In this game, we put ourselves in the skin of a taxist. We owe a lot of money to a group of gangsters and they have just found us, so we must run away and try to mislead them by driving around the city.

## HOW TO PLAY 

### CONTROLS

- Move the car: 
  - ARROWS

- Return the car to the last checkpoint:
  - SPACE
  
- Restart the level:
  - R
  
### IMPORTANT THINGS

The level must be completed in less than 2:40 minutes, if you don't make to reach it, gangsters will catch you!

The window of the game will show you some messages on each checkpoint, to tell you if you are doing good or you must run a bit more.

When you pass through a checkpoint, the respective lighter will turn on the green light. You can not pass the level if you don't have all the lighters on green, so, don't try to cheat!
